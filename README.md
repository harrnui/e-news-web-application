# e-news Web Application

- The project isn't finished. I figured out the main concepts (which are: bulding in a MVC model, a client-side, server-side, the database, and the commmunication between all of them.) all of the rest are seeming like details (which are: actually uploading news posts to the app for testing, finishing the admin options panel, basically finishing the app). I am gonna be honest that lazzines has took me.

## MVC model:

- Implementing the Seperation of Concernes via Model, View and a Controller.
- Main reasons of implementing the MVC are easiear readability, easier to start where you left off and easier to maintain or build upon.
- ***Model*** is used for making the logic of the app , ***controller*** for making the routes for communication between all parts of the app and the ***view*** which has the client side stored.

## Client-side:

- is made with ***HTML,CSS*** and ***JavaScript***.
- it isn't responsive.
- the main page is dynamic.

## Server-side:

- is made in ***express.js***.
- i frogot to implement ***JWT tokens***.
- image storage via ***multer*** and repost on client-side as a news post.
- passwords are hashed via ***bycrpt***.

## Database:

- for database ***PostgreSQL*** is used.
